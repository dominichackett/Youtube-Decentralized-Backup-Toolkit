## Summary

The Youtube decentralized Backup Toolkit is a decentralized application (DAPP) that enables content creators to securely store and monetize their work on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Polygon network. It consists of a command-line interface (CLI) for downloading Youtube videos and a NextJS web application for managing the uploading of content to IPFS. The DAPP utilizes W3ui for authentication and Ceramaic composedb for storing channel and video metadata.
