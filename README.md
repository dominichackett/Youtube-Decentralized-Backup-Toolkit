## Summary

The Youtube decentralized Backup Toolkit is a decentralized application (DAPP) that enables content creators to securely store and monetize their work on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Arweave/Bundlr and the Polygon network. It consists of a command-line interface (CLI) for downloading Youtube videos and a NextJS web application for managing the uploading of content to IPFS. The DAPP utilizes W3ui for authentication and Ceramaic composedb for storing channel and video metadata. The Livepeer player from LivepeerJS is used to play videos from IPFS, and the toolkit allows users to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for their videos on the Polygon and APTOS networks.

## Overview

The Youtube decentralized Backup Toolkit is a decentralized application (DAPP) that enables content creators to backup their Youtube channels to InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Arweave/Bundlr. It was developed for the Encode Club Next Video Build hackathon and consists of a command-line interface (CLI) and a NextJS web application.

The CLI allows users to download Youtube videos, while the NextJS app helps them manage the uploading of content to IPFS. The DAPP utilizes W3ui for authentication and Ceramaic composedb to store channel and video metadata. The Livepeer player from LivepeerJS is used to play videos from IPFS.

In addition, the Youtube decentralized Backup Toolkit allows users to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for their videos on the Polygon and APTOS networks. This feature allows creators to monetize their content and gives their fans the opportunity to own a unique and verifiable digital asset.

Overall, the Youtube decentralized Backup Toolkit is a useful tool for content creators looking to securely store and monetize their work in a decentralized manner.
